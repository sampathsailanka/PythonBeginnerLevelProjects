In this we are making 4 projects which are listed below:

1.Number_Guesser:          In this game the computer picks a random number 
                           which takes the Range from input given by the user.
                           Then we'll Enter a number,if the computer pick is equal to our's
                           pick then the game over.
                           It displays in how many chances you have guessed correctly.

2.Quiz_Game:               In this game there are limited amount of questions which should be answered.
                           After answering all the questions it displays the score for how many
                           answers are correct out of total number of questions.

3.Rock_Papers_Scissors:    This is probably the favourite game for most of them.
                           As we all know the rules. If scissor and paper are faced then scissor
                           wins. If scissor and rock faces rock wins. If Paper and rock faces
                           then paper wins.
                           In this game the computer picks any options in rock,paper,scissors and
                           then the user gives the input from rock,paper,scissors.
                           The scores are noted taken by the computer after each round and displays
                           the Score.

4.Choose_Your_Own_Adventure: This is the most creative game to create. It makes the best story building.
                             But, Tnis is a sample game, so there is no much story included.
                             In this game the answer is given by the user based on the question.
                             And it displays the two paths given and we have to choose one.
                             In this way the story goes.Atlast it displays the user is "Won" or "Lost".
